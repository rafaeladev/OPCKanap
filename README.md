> **Back end Prerequisites**

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

> **Back end Installation**

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install` . You can then run the server with `node server`.

The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
